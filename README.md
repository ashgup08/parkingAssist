# Parking Assist

*Raspberry Pi operated contraption that helps people park without bumping into things.*

## Problem
There are appropxiamtely 2.5 million people starting the road fresh every year in the United States. The nation experiences around 6 million car accidents every year as well. Getting involved into a car accident can range from being insiginficiant to life changing.

One of the ways we could possibly reduce these unfortunate rate is by helping people to park properly. Although this assist was never attended to address the devastating high speed collissions that people hear about occasionally, it is one step towards addressing the big problem. Getting into a car accident, whether small or big, not only hurts people in damages but in time. Such events disrupts their schedule easily. his assist could eventually reduce those moments when people are forced to become a sitting duck when they are needing to rush to work, race to a sale, or fetch a last minute piece of equipment for their team.

Once again, this is a step towards the big problem.

## Conceptialization 
The system was initally planned to incorporate a Raspberry Pi 5 as the main control system, an ultrasonic sensor to record the distance of the car (HRSC04), and an electronic buzzer.
